# Connected Apps Guide

This guide described how your application can request TransferWise customers to grant access to their account. 

Note that asking TransferWise users to copy-paste their Transferwise API tokens directly into your application is a violation of our security policy.  So please only use proper OAuth authorization flow as described below.
 
## API access

TransferWise uses standard OAuth 2.0 protocol for authentication and authorization. 

Once our partnership begins, we’ll send you API access credentials for the sandbox environment consisting of a Client ID and a Client Secret.
The credentials are needed to complete the authorisation_code grant type of OAuth 2.0 through which the customer will allow your application to be able to act on their behalf.
We also need *redirect_url* from your technical team so that we can limit our callbacks to only that URL, this is URL that we will forward users to after successfully granting your application access to their TransferWise account. Specifying this explicitly makes the integration more secure.
<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This article about OAuth 2.0 framework</a> is a great way to refresh your knowledge about the protocol itself.

### SANDBOX and LIVE environments

* Sandbox API is located at https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech
* LIVE API is located at https://api.transferwise.com

## Get user authorization

At a high level there are three steps to gaining access to an existing TransferWise account.
<ol>
  <li>Your app redirects the user to TransferWise authorization webpage, which prompts customers to login.<br/>
  </li>
  <li>The user logs in to TransferWise.</li>
  <li> The user agrees to provide access, the TransferWise authorization page then redirects user back to your preconfigured url, including a code you can use to geneate user tokens. e.g.
  `
  https://www.yourapp.com/?code=[CODE]
  `
  </li>
</ol>

These steps are explained in more detail below.

###  1. Your application redirects user to TransferWise authorization webpage

Your website or app opens the following url in the user's browser.

Sandbox:  
`
https://sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/authorize/?client_id={clientId}&redirect_uri={redirectUri}
` <br/>
Live:  
`
https://transferwise.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id={clientId}&redirect_uri={redirectUri}
`

List of available parameters:

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
client_id (required) | The client ID you received from us.
redirect_uri (required) | The preconfigured URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization.
state | An opaque value, used for security purposes. If this parameter is set in the request, then it is returned to the application as part of the redirect_uri. <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/oauth2/oauth-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">More about state parameter</a>.

*On mobiles apps you should not use `WebView` components to show the authorization page to the users because they are not secure and will not allow users to log in to TransferWise with Google, which is an option used by some of our users. Your app should instead open the device's full browser app.*

### 2. The user logs in to TransferWise

Our usual log in screens are presented to the user if they are not already logged in on the browser being used. If enabled for a user they will also be prompted to go through our two-factor authentication procedure.

### 3. The user agrees to grant access and we forward them to your *redirect_url*

Once a user gives your application authorization to connect to TransferWise and access their data, the user is redirected back to your *redirect_url* with a generated code query string value. For example

`https://www.yourapp.com/?code=[CODE]`

Your website or service can then use this code to obtain the access token to act on behalf of the user account described in the [get user tokens](#conncted-apps-guide-get-user-tokens) section.

If you are building your TransferWise integration as a native mobile phone app then the redirect URL should be able to handle returning the user to the correct place in the app.

*Please note that provided `[CODE]` expires within 30 minutes and is one time use only.*

### Error handling

When authorization request returns an error response, we display the message on our webpage. The user may also see a link back to your application, with `error` and `error_description` parameters in the url instead of `code`.

## Get user tokens
You can now use authorization code returned to you as a query string parameter to obtain user access and refresh tokens. So that you can make calls on behalf of TransferWise user.

> Example Request:

```shell
curl \
-u '[your-api-client-id]:[your-api-client-secret]' \
-d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
-d 'client_id=[your-api-client-id]' \
-d 'code=[code-from-redirect-uri]' \
-d 'redirect_uri=https://www.yourapp.com' \
'https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/token' 
```

You will be returned an access token and a refresh token.

> Example Response:

```json
  {
    "access_token":"ba8k9935-62f2-475a-60d8-6g45377b4062",
    "token_type":"bearer",
    "refresh_token":"a235uu9c-9azu-4o28-a1kn-e15500o151cx",
    "expires_in": 43199,
    "scope":"transfers"
  }
```
For calling API endpoints you need to provide the user's `access_token` in the request's HTTP header in the format `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
Access tokens are short lived for security reasons, they are only valid for 12 hours by default. When they expire you need to use the `refresh_token` to generate a new access_token.

This means you have to securely store the user's `refresh_token` in order to generate a new `access_token` each time they use your TransferWise integration, or you poll for updated data,

### Request

Use Basic Authentication with your api-client-id/api-client-secret as username/pwd.

### Response

Field                 | Description                                   | Format
---------             | -------                                       | -----------

token_type            | "bearer"                                      | Text
refresh_token         | Refresh token which you need to use in order to request new access_token. The lifetime of refresh tokens is 10 years. | uuid
expires_in            | Expiry time in seconds                        | Integer
scope                 | "transfers"                                   | Text

## Refresh user access token

> Example Request:

```shell
      curl \
      'https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/oauth/token' \
      -u '[your-api-client-id]:[your-api-client-secret]' \
      -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
      -d 'refresh_token=[user's refresh token]'
```

> Example Response:

```json
  {
    "access_token":"be69d566-971e-4e15-9648-85a486195863",
    "token_type":"bearer",
    "refresh_token":"1d0ec7b9-b569-426d-a18d-8dead5b6a3cc",
    "expires_in":43199,
    "scope":"transfers"
  }
```

Access tokens are valid for 12 hours, so upon expiry you need to use refresh_token to generate new access_token. 

In order to maintain an uninterrupted connection, you can request a new access token whenever it’s close to expiring.
There is no need to wait for the actual expiration to happen first.

## Token Expiry

It is possible that a user's refresh token will become invalid. This could happen for a number of reasons, for example:

* The user revokes access for your application to their account.
* The user enables enhanced security on their TransferWise account.
* TransferWise revoke tokens due to a security breach of your client secret.

Due to this possibility your application should handle a failing refresh token scenario by sending the user through the authorization code flow as you initially did.
