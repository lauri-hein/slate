### Avoiding duplicate transfers
We use **customerTransactionId** field to avoid duplicate transfer requests. 
When your first call fails (error or timeout) then you should use the same value in **customerTransactionId** field that you used in the original call when you are submitting a retry message. 
This way we can treat subsequent retry messages as **repeat messages** and will not create duplicate transfers to your account. 


## Fund

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v1/transfers/{transferId}/payments \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ 
          "type": "BALANCE"   
         }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "type": "BALANCE",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "errorCode": null
}
```

This API call is the final step for executing payouts. TransferWise will now debit funds from your borderless balance and start processing your transfer. 
If your borderless balance is short of funds then this call will fail with "insufficient funds" error.

### Request

Almost every country has their own specific originality when it comes to the nitty gritty details of domestic payment systems and money transfer regulations. 
Maximum allowed length of reference text is a good example. The US payment system, ACH, supports 10 characters only, but transfers within Mexico allow up to 100 characters and so on.

Same is true for requirements arising from Anti-Money Laundering regulations adopted in different countries. Transfers from and to USD almost always require more details about source of funds and transfer purpose, compared to transfers to EUR or GBP.

Endpoint /transfer-requirements exposes all these specific requirements based on specific quote and target recipient account.

To make sure that processing of your transfers does not get delayed because of missing details, we highly recommend to verify the transfer requirements before before submitting any transfer.


### Request
**` POST https://api.sandbox.transferwise.tech/v1/transfer-requirements`**<br/>


1.Prepare request body to create transfer object first. 
Now post this request body to transfer-requirements endpoint to figure out if there are any other required fields.


2.Analyze the returned list of fields. Our example includes reference, sourceOfFunds and transferPurpose fields.  Field 'reference' is optional. Fields 'sourceOfFunds' and 'transferPurpose' are required and both have 
refreshRequirementsOnChange=true which indicates that there could be additional fields required depending on the selected value.

In our example you will have to POST request to/v1/transfer-requirements` second time as well with values set for 'transferPurpose' and 'sourceOfFunds'.
So in case you set sourceOfFunds = 'verification.source.of.funds.other'  then another text field called "sourceOfFundsOther" is also required where you need to specify the details in free format.

3.Once you get to the point where you have provided values for all fields which have refreshRequirementsOnChange=true then you have complete set of fields to compose a valid request to create a transfer object. 
For example this is a valid request to create a transfer.
<br/> POST /v1/transfers:<br/>

### Avoiding duplicate transfers
We use **originalTransferId** field to avoid duplicate transfer requests. 
When your first call fails (error or timeout) then you should use the same value in **originalTransferId** field that you used in the original call when you are submitting a retry message. 
This way we can treat subsequent retry messages as **repeat messages** and will not create duplicate transfers to your account.
