# Application Webhooks

Application webhook subscription is a mechanism that will allow you to receive notifications to your servers whenever various events happen in relation to different resources created by an ***application***. You can subscribe to receive webhooks about resource created under a specific [***profile***](#profile-webhooks).

Before proceeding, make sure the endpoint where you intend to receive webhooks satisfies the following requirements:

* Has a valid domain name (IP addresses are disallowed)
* Listens to HTTPS requests on port `443`
* Has a valid HTTPS certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority - CA (self-signed or expired certificates are not accepted)
* Does not include any query arguments in the URL

`https://webhooks.example.com/balance-change` is a valid URL; `http://webhooks.example.com:8080/hook.php?type=balance` is not.

You can have multiple subscriptions per event type though be mindful you will receive duplicate callbacks, one for each subscription.

> **Please note that you have to use a client level token for making following requests.**
