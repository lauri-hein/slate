Webhook subscription is a mechanism that will allow you to receive notifications to your servers whenever your transfers and/or balance get updated.

Before proceeding, make sure the endpoint where you intend to receive webhooks satisfies the following requirements:

* Has a valid domain name (IP-s are not allowed)
* Listens to HTTPS requests on port `443`
* Has a valid HTTPS certificate signed by a trusted CA (self-signed or expired certificates are not accepted)
* Does not include any query arguments in the URI

`https://webhooks.example.com/balance-change` is a valid URL; `http://webhooks.example.com:8080/hook.php?type=balance` is not.

Currently we are delivering all notifications and `enabled_notifications` criteria will not be taken into account.

**NB! Please note this feature is not available in sandbox environment.**

## Events

Events describe payload that will be sent to your server in a form of a `POST` request. They will not contain any personally identifiable information. To acknowledge succesfully processed event, make sure your server answers with a status code `200` within 5s. Otherwise, we will try to resend the notification 3 times consequently.

## Test event

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.transferwise.com/v1/webhooks/ping \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
       "callback_url": "<URL of your server>"
      }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "code": 200,
  "elapsed": 228
}
```

You can trigger a test event to be delivered to your server to check the connection between systems.
