# Webhooks

There's two ways you can manage webhooks:

* via API (read more below)
* via user interface (go to your <a href="https://transferwise.com/user/settings#webhooks" target="_blank">settings page</a>)

For the data that will be sent to your server see [events section.](#webhooks-events)

## Create

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.transferwise.com/v1/subscriptions/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
       "name": "Webhook Subscription #1",
       "channel_id": "WEBHOOK",
       "callback_url": "<URL of your server>",
       "profile_id": <ID of the profile you want to receive notifications from>,
       "enabled_notifications": ["transfers", "balance"]
      }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "id": "abcde123-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcde1234567",
  "name": "Webhook Subscription #1",
  "channel_id": "WEBHOOK",
  "user_id": "TW::<your user ID>",
  "status": "ENABLED",
  "created_on": "2019-03-10T09:32:15.663Z",
  "url": "<URL of your server>",
  "profile_id": <ID of the profile you want to receive notifications from>,
  "enabled_notifications": [
    "balance",
    "transfers"
  ]
}
```

Webhook subscription is a mechanism that will allow you to receive notifications to your servers whenever your transfers and/or balance get updated.

Before proceeding, make sure the endpoint where you intend to receive webhooks satisfies the following requirements:

* Has a valid domain name (IP-s are not allowed)
* Listens to HTTPS requests on port `443`
* Has a valid HTTPS certificate signed by a trusted CA (self-signed or expired certificates are not accepted)
* Does not include any query arguments in the URI

`https://webhooks.example.com/balance-change` is a valid URL; `http://webhooks.example.com:8080/hook.php?type=balance` is not.

Currently we are delivering all notifications and `enabled_notifications` criteria will not be taken into account.

**NB! Please note this feature is not available in sandbox environment.**

## Events

Events describe payload that will be sent to your server in a form of a `POST` request. They will not contain any personally identifiable information. To acknowledge succesfully processed event, make sure your server answers with a status code `200` within 5s. Otherwise, we will try to resend the notification 3 times consequently.


### Signature header

> TransferWise public key for production environment:

```
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAvO8vXV+JksBzZAY6GhSO
XdoTCfhXaaiZ+qAbtaDBiu2AGkGVpmEygFmWP4Li9m5+Ni85BhVvZOodM9epgW3F
bA5Q1SexvAF1PPjX4JpMstak/QhAgl1qMSqEevL8cmUeTgcMuVWCJmlge9h7B1CS

HwIDAQAB
```

> How to verify signature (in Java):

```java
public boolean verifySignature(String publicKey, String signature, String payload) {
  X509EncodedKeySpec publicKeySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(Base64.decode(pubicKey));
  KeyFactory keyFactory = KeyFactory.getInstance("RSA");
  PublicKey publicKey = keyFactory.generatePublic(publicKeySpec);
  
  Signature sign = Signature.getInstance("SHA1WithRSA");
  sign.initVerify(publicKey);
  
  byte[] data = payload.getBytes();
  sign.update(data);
  
  byte[] signatureBytes = Base64.decode(signature);
  
  return sign.verify(signatureBytes);
}
```

Each outgoing webhook request is signed. Whilst event payloads do not contain any sensitive information, you may want to verify if the request is coming from TransferWise (however this is optional). We advise you not to process any requests where signature appears to be forged.

Each `POST` request includes `X-Signature` header, which contains a signature.


## Test event

> Example Request:

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.transferwise.com/v1/webhooks/ping \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your api token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
       "callback_url": "<URL of your server>"
      }'
```

> Example Response:

```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "code": 200,
  "elapsed": 228
}
```

You can trigger a test event to be delivered to your server to check the connection between systems.
